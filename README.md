Hello World!
Basically what happens when the camera is no longer a parent of the cat anymore it becomes a static stand in place camera. It is no longer attached to the movement of the cat, thereby not allowing you to follow in any perspective of the character you are controling. It is similar to, for example, old Gary's mod animations, where you have control of the character but not the camera. When an object is not the child of another, it does not move with that parent, thereby staying complely stagnant in relation to the game object it was once attached to, or running a completly different type of code all together. they just disconect, parents are like a grouping tool that keep all movements together.

The RGB variables are all floats instead of numbers because all of those values corrispond to each color values, including intencities, darkness, lighnes, and many other things. So all of those values need to be represented by more specsific values instead of whole numbers, hence the decimal float. The bounce variable is an int instead of any of those other variables because it is a whole number that corrisponds to the units in which a ball bounces up or down, you don't need fractional jumps in that instance. The error in that code for that section that unity made me aware of was that a semi colon was expected.
